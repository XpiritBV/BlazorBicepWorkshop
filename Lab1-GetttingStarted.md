# Building a modern web application on Azure, using Blazor and Bicep

This workshop will help you get started building Cloud-native software and Infrastructure as Code for your own projects!

You will build a modern web application, using Blazor and .NET 6. Once completed, you will create Azure infrastructure by using Bicep, and run the Blazor app in the Cloud.

## Required knowledge
Even though this is an introductory workshop, you will need to bring some experience using C# and a basic understanding of the resource model of Azure.

## What you will learm
In the morning, you will learn how to create a basic Blazor web app, that uses an Identity Provider to authenticate users and integrates with a message queue inside Azure. The source code will also feature some new C# features.
In the afternoon, you will learn how to use Infrastructure as Code to create the infrastructure needed to run the Blazor web app. 

This workshop will help you get started building cloud native software and Infrastructure as Code for your own projects!
