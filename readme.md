# Building a modern web application on Azure, using Blazor and Bicep

This workshop will help you get started building Cloud-native software and Infrastructure as Code for your own projects!

You will build a modern web application, using Blazor and .NET 6. Once completed, you will create Azure infrastructure by using Bicep, and run the Blazor app in the Cloud.

## Required knowledge

Even though this is an introductory workshop, you will need to bring some experience using C# and a basic understanding of the resource model of Azure.

## What you will learm

In the morning, you will learn how to create a basic Blazor web app, that uses an Identity Provider to authenticate users and integrates with a message queue inside Azure. The source code will also feature some new C# features. In the afternoon, you will learn how to use Infrastructure as Code to create the infrastructure needed to run the Blazor web app.
